# Bike Trips in NYC

## Overveiw
In this project we were tasked with creating a talbeau story depicting the statistic of bike usage in New York City. We want to show peak hours, duration of checkout and a heat map as well as filtering by gender and user.

### The Deliverables

The image above shows the breakdown by gender and age of customers.

The peak hours are important in this project because it can show us things like when to do maintance and other things.
In the citiBikes.twbx file there's more images and the story. If you would like to look at that or if I misunderstood what was wanted in the readme; please take a look at that file as it should provide the missing things.

### Summary
This project showed us how to use a new tool to show the data we collect. The applications of this program is verry useful. I would maybe take a look at doing a map of where the bikes are checked out and where they get checked back it.  It could show us a place where we need to load up more on bikes. I also provided a few maps I thought would be useful in the .twbx file.
